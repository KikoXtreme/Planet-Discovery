    <h3>Welcome Explorers!</h3>
    <p>
        The successes of discovering exoplanets in recent decades seem to be telling us that the galaxy is teeming with
        trillions of exoplanets, but finding them isn't easy. Planets are typically billions of times fainter than the
        stars they orbit, and they are incredibly distant.</p>
    <p>
        Whether life exists beyond Earth is one of the most profound questions of all time. The answer will change us
        forever, whether it reveals a universe rich with life, one in which life is rare and fragile, or even a universe
        in which we can find no other life at all.
    </p>
    <p>
        The hunt for an answer also is revealing important details about our own place in the universe - where we came
        from, how life came about and, perhaps, where we're headed.
